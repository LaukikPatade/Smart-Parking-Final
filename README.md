# Smart-Parking-Final
A crypto-solution to your modern day parking problems.

## Features
Decentralized Parking Space Management: The smart parking system eliminates the need for a centralized authority by leveraging blockchain technology. Parking space ownership, availability, and transactions are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and integrity.

Real-Time Parking Space Monitoring: The system  monitors parking space occupancy in real-time. Users can access the system through a web application to view available parking spaces and make reservations.

Secure and Immutable Transactions: All parking space transactions, including reservations, payments, and ownership transfers, are securely recorded on the blockchain. The decentralized nature of the blockchain ensures that transactions cannot be altered or tampered with, providing a high level of security and trust.

Smart Contracts: Smart contracts are employed to automate and enforce the rules and conditions of parking space reservations and payments. The smart contracts execute autonomously, eliminating the need for intermediaries and reducing the risk of human error or fraud.

Payment Integration: The system supports various payment methods through metamask. Users can conveniently pay for their parking reservations through the integrated payment system.

## System Architecture
The smart parking system is built using the following technologies and components:

Blockchain Platform: Ethereum - The Ethereum blockchain is used for its smart contract functionality and decentralized nature.

Smart Contracts: Solidity - Solidity is the programming language used to develop the smart contracts that govern parking space transactions.

Front-End: React - The user interface is developed using the React JavaScript framework, providing a responsive and intuitive interface for users.

Back-End: Node.js - The back-end server is built using Node.js, providing a scalable and efficient server-side infrastructure.

Database: MongoDB - MongoDB is used as the database to store auxiliary information related to parking spaces, user profiles, and vehicle data.

## Installation


To run the blockchain-based smart parking system locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LaukikPatade/Smart-Parking-Final.git
```

2. Install the necessary dependencies for the front-end and back-end:

```bash
cd Client
npm install

cd ../Server
npm install
```

## You are good to go!

3. Run the application
Start the front-end development server:

```bash
cd Client
npm start
```

Start the back-end server:
```bash
cd Server
nodemon index.js
```

4. Open your web browser and visit https://localhost:3000
