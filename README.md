# Features
Decentralized Parking Space Management: The smart parking system eliminates the need for a centralized authority by leveraging blockchain technology. Parking space ownership, availability, and transactions are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and integrity.

Real-Time Parking Space Monitoring: The system  monitors parking space occupancy in real-time. Users can access the system through a web application to view available parking spaces and make reservations.

Secure and Immutable Transactions: All parking space transactions, including reservations, payments, and ownership transfers, are securely recorded on the blockchain. The decentralized nature of the blockchain ensures that transactions cannot be altered or tampered with, providing a high level of security and trust.

Smart Contracts: Smart contracts are employed to automate and enforce the rules and conditions of parking space reservations and payments. The smart contracts execute autonomously, eliminating the need for intermediaries and reducing the risk of human error or fraud.

Payment Integration: The system supports various payment methods through metamask. Users can conveniently pay for their parking reservations through the integrated payment system.
